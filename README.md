# ðŸŒŸ Practice Cypress for Exam on Cypress 101 Certificate by Lambdatest ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **Practice Cypress for Exam** project! In this project, we embark on a journey from basic to real-world usage of Cypress, all in preparation for the Cypress 101 Certificate exam offered by Lambdatest.

## Overview
This project is a culmination of studies following Lambdatest's recommendations, ensuring sufficient knowledge for testing and obtaining the certificate. You can directly study from Lambdatest's website: [Cypress 101 Certification](https://www.lambdatest.com/certifications/cypress-101), exploring the suggested topics provided there. My approach in this project focuses on utilizing Cypress with TypeScript instead of JavaScript because I aim to enhance my TypeScript skills alongside Cypress.

In this project, we have forked the [Cypress.io](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) repository to enable testing on local domains, utilizing React alongside Cypress. We have also referenced related repositories such as [cypress-example-kitchensink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) for additional learning and inspiration.

Special thanks to [Lambdatest](https://www.lambdatest.com/)  for offering an excellent and free course, providing opportunities for practice and self-improvement.

ðŸš€ Let's delve into the world of Cypress and TypeScript together! ðŸš€
